# Giphy Search for Alfred

This Alfred workflow lets you instantly **search for GIFs on Giphy** and quickly copy them for use in WhatsApp, Telegram, iMessage, or any app! You can search, preview, and copy GIFs without leaving your keyboard.

## Workaround

At the moment, there are still dependency issues, to overcome those you can follow this in your Terminal:

1. Ensure you have pip installed:
```
# Check your pip version
/usr/bin/python3 -m pip --version
# If you get an error like "no module named pip", run:
/usr/bin/python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade
```

2. Install required modules:
```
/usr/bin/python3 -m pip install --upgrade --user requests urllib3 charset_normalizer
```
You should now be able to run the search without an issue.
